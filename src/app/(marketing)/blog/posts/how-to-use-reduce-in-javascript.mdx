# What is Array reduce in JavaScript?

Array.reduce is a powerful array method in JavaScript. It allows you to 'reduce' (or you can think of it as 'summarize') an array of values into a single value. It is perfect 
for when you need to get a single value from a list of values. 
<br />

<div className="my-4">
### Let's take a look at a simple example:
</div>

<CodeSnippet language="javascript" content={`const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
console.log(sum); // 15`} />

<br />

<div className="my-4">
In this example, we are summing up all the numbers in the array. The reduce function takes two arguments: a callback function and an initial value. A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function. The callback function takes two arguments: the accumulator (acc) and the current value (curr). 
<br />
The accumulator is the value that is being accumulated, or in other words the running total. In each iteration, the accumulator holds the running total of all values processed so far. The current value (curr) is the array element being processed in the current iteration.

<br />

The initial value (0 in this case) is the starting value for the accumulator. When reduce begins executing, acc starts as 0, then becomes 1 after the first iteration, 3 after the second, 6 after the third, and so on until it reaches the final sum of 15.
</div>

<div className="my-4">
### Syntax:
</div>

<CodeSnippet language="javascript" content={`Array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), initialValue)`} />

<div className="my-4">
### Use Cases:
</div>


<div className="my-4">
The reduce function is a powerful tool for summarizing data. It is used in a wide variety of applications, from calculating the total cost of an order to summing up the number of votes for a candidate.
<br />
Let's take a look at some real-world examples using the reduce function.
</div>

<br />

### Example 1: Calculate total cost of items in a shopping cart - using array reduce with an object

<CodeSnippet language="javascript" content={`// Calculate total cost of items in a shopping cart
const shoppingCart = [
  { item: 'Laptop', price: 999.99 },
  { item: 'Headphones', price: 99.99 },
  { item: 'Mouse', price: 29.99 },
  { item: 'Keyboard', price: 59.99 }
];

const totalCost = shoppingCart.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0);
console.log(\`Total cost: $\${totalCost.toFixed(2)}\`); // Total cost: $1189.96`} />

<br />

Let's break down what's happening in this example step by step:

<div className="my-4">

1. First, we have an array of objects called `shoppingCart`. Each object represents an item with two properties:
   - `item`: The name of the product
   - `price`: The cost of that product

2. We use the reduce method to calculate the total cost. Here's how it works:
   - The initial value is set to `0` (the **second** argument in reduce)
   - In each iteration, we add the current item's price to our running total
   - The `total` parameter keeps track of our accumulated sum
   - The `item` parameter represents the current object being processed

3. Let's see how the values change in each iteration:
   - Start: total = 0
   - First iteration: 0 + 999.99 = 999.99 (**Laptop**)
   - Second iteration: 999.99 + 99.99 = 1099.98 (**Headphones**)
   - Third iteration: 1099.98 + 29.99 = 1129.97 (**Mouse**)
   - Final iteration: 1129.97 + 59.99 = 1189.96 (**Keyboard**)

4. Finally, we format the output using:
   - Template literals (`) to create the string
   - The `toFixed(2)` method to ensure we show exactly 2 decimal places

This is a common real-world example of using reduce to calculate a sum from an array of objects, similar to what you might find in an e-commerce application.
</div>

<br />

### Example 2: Count the frequency of numbers in an array

<CodeSnippet language="javascript" content={`// Count how many times each number appears
const numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5];

const frequency = numbers.reduce((count, num) => {
    count[num] = (count[num] || 0) + 1;
    return count;
}, {});

console.log(frequency);
/* Output:
{
  1: 1,  // number 1 appears once
  2: 2,  // number 2 appears twice 
  3: 3,  // number 3 appears three times
  4: 2,  // number 4 appears twice
  5: 1   // number 5 appears once
}
*/`} />

<br />

Let's break down this example step by step:

<div className="my-4">

1. First, we start with an array of numbers that has some duplicates:
<CodeSnippet language="javascript" content={`const numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5];`} />

2. We use reduce with an empty object `{}` as the initial value:
<CodeSnippet language="javascript" content={`const frequency = numbers.reduce((count, num) => {}, {});`} />

3. For each number in the array, we:
 For each number in the array, we:
   - Check if the number exists as a key in our object using `count[num]`
   - If it doesn't exist, use `0` as the default value with `|| 0`
   - Add 1 to the count
   - Return the updated count object

4. Let's see how the object changes in each iteration:


5. The key part of this code is the line:
<CodeSnippet language="javascript" content={`count[num] = (count[num] || 0) + 1;`} />
   This is a shorthand way of writing:
<CodeSnippet language="javascript" content={`if (count[num] === undefined) {
    count[num] = 1;
} else {
    count[num] = count[num] + 1;
}`} />

This pattern is commonly used when you need to count occurrences in an array or create frequency maps, such as in analytics, data processing, or character frequency counting in strings.
