# What is Array reduce in JavaScript?

Array.reduce is a powerful array method in JavaScript. It allows you to 'reduce' (or you can think of it as 'summarize') an array of values into a single value. This 
is useful for when you need to get a single value of a list of values. 

<br />

<div className="my-4">
Let's take a look at an example:
</div>

<CodeSnippet language="javascript" content={`const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
console.log(sum); // 15`} />

<br />

<div className="my-4">
In this example, we are adding up all the numbers in the array to get their total sum. Let's break down how it works:

<br />

The reduce function needs two things:
1. A function that tells it what to do with each number (we tell it to add them together)
2. A starting value (we use 0 as our starting point)

<br />

Think of it like a running total:
- We start with 0 (our initial value)
- First, we add 1 to get 1
- Then we add 2 to get 3
- Then we add 3 to get 6
- Then we add 4 to get 10
- Finally, we add 5 to get 15

<br />

The accumulator (acc) is like our notepad where we keep track of this running total. The current value (curr) is just the next number we're adding to our total.
</div>

<div className="my-4">
### Syntax:
</div>

<CodeSnippet language="javascript" content={`Array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), initialValue)`} />
